### About Me

I'm in my third year of Computer Science with AI at the University of Leeds, with a strong interest in machine learning and data science. Currently, I'm working on a dissertation focused on enhancing NLP chatbots using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning techniques to improve university course teaching.

Alongside my studies, I've been integrating personal projects with my coursework to deepen my understanding of these concepts in practical settings. I'm continuously seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills in this field!
